## ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About me

I am a software developer based in Montreal, Canada who mostly enjoy unix systems programming, networking, distributed systems, databases and the performance implications of these systems and their interactions. I like to contribute to open source whenever I get the time and opportunity. Genuinely curious, I strive to learn as much as I can everyday and improve my craft of software engineering and other interests.
